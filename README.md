# cryptopy
Python cryptography program using fernet

Installation:-
No install required. you can directly encrypt/decrypt a file by placing it in the same directory as voldemort.py, and running voldemort.py
For doing this in a shiny way, use the bashscript 'cryptopy' provided. You could use your own script, but to use mine,
(a bit of work, but anyways..) create 3 folders named .proton .neutron and .electron . Place precryptic and voldemort.py in .proton and the text file in 
.neutron . Name the text file testfile and just run the bashscript 'cryptopy' in the terminal. 

Note: You could always change the filenames in both the .py and bashscript according to your needs
