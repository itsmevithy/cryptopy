# cryptopy
Python cryptography program using fernet

Usage:-
You can directly encrypt/decrypt a file by placing it in the same directory as voldemort.py. You could also use the bashscript 'cryptopy' provided, or use your own script. For this, create 3 folders named .proton [working directory], .neutron [file directory],  and .electron [key directory]. Place precryptic and voldemort.py in .proton and the text file in .neutron. Name the text file testfile and just run the bashscript 'cryptopy' in the terminal. In the initial run, key will be placed in .electron, which could later be changed.
